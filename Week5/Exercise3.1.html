           Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
           refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
		   development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop
		   browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has
		   become ever-increasingly important.
